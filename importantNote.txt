When email system is banned by service provider, we use the following method to pretend our server can work:
DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=eventplatform2
EMAIL_USER=skip
EMAIL_USER_BK=alantestcode2023@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=A214365*

However, when the email system is normal, we should do the practice as the following:

DB_USER=postgres
DB_PASSWORD=postgres
DB_NAME=eventplatform2
EMAIL_USER=alantestcode2023@outlook.com
EMAIL_PASSWORD=A214365*
